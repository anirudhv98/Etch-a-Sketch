# Etch-a-Sketch

This is a simple Etch-a-Sketch game implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

### Functionality

- Hovering inside the grid will toggle the color function, which fills every cell when the mouse pointer hovers over it.
- Clicking the Reset button calls the clear function which provides a clean slate so you can color the grid again.
