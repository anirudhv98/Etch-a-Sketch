# Etch-a-Sketch

This is a simple Etch-a-Sketch game implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

### Functionality

- Hovering inside the grid will toggle the blackColor function, which fills every cell when the mouse pointer hovers over it.
- Clicking the RGB button toggles the randomColor function that allows the cells to be filled with a random color and clicking the Black button fills the cells with black color.
- Clicking the Reset button calls the clear function which provides a clean slate so you can color the grid again.
- The range slider can be used to toggle between a 2x2 grid and a 100x100 grid. By default, the size of the grid is 16x16.
